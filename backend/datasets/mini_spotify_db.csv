ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near

And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning

Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood

You will have no time for grieving

And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle

Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk

When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""

Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please

I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)

Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee

Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face

Honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
You look like a movie star (You look like a movie star)

Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl

But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl

And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun

Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice

Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot

And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh

Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me

I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride

In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon

That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through

I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow

We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away

We could laugh and play

You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?

He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry

Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me

No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please

And I have to sit down for a while

And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Slipping through my fingers all the time

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Someone to lean on, well I understand  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue

He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I've ever tasted  
My brain's been erased-ed  
Well fucking fried  
  
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted  
Oh fucking shit  
  
I'm way too baked

Building castles in the sand

Will this kid end up smokin' weed?

And you keep on growin'  
You're now six years old  
You're getting so good at your spellin'  
But my mind is always dwellin'  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
You're lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein'  
Such a fuckin' pothead?  
There's other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin' your herb  
You can't get enough of  
Your precious, precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?

And turn me into a crumbling fool.

If you want me to stop I'll freeze,

Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.

The crazier I turn into.

In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish I'd said  
At the dawning of the day  
I can't wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[Hook]  
I can't drown in your tears  
I won't face your fears  
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know I'll survive  
You'll never see me again

She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club

Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence

Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why

Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried

Remember,  
Her smile was so inviting,  
Remember,  
And then she touched my cheek,  
Remember,  
With her fingertip.  
Remember,  
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.  
  
Whatever happened to,  
That girl that I once knew.  
That girl that said she'd be true.  
Whatever happened to,  
That night I gave her to you.  
What will I do with it now.

The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...

Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

I was afraid of things that I can't see  
I can't see love but I like it a lot  
I used to take a life in the back seat  
Until the front row began to move off  
There must be more to sleep than waking  
I was so sure there was something waiting  
There

All people used to seem tall  
When everyday would be voices calling  
I'd take no notice at all  
I'd take no notice at all  
Then when I asked if you'd  
Held conversation  
I was the talk of the town  
Until the voice let me see in the future  
They didn't look so way down  
  
I have to make you listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make you listen now

Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land

The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find

The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see

But I can't see why you didn't stay  
Why you didn't come to see if I felt  
The same way  
And I do, and I do  
I never asked for any comfort  
To take up your time  
But now I feel so very different  
I need to make you mine  
And I want to take what you have to  
Give me  
And bring you the words that fall  
From my head  
And I will, and I will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will  
Know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will, always will

And now it seems that every time  
I look into your eyes  
There is only so far I can see

Where only we can go  
When you touch me the memories unfold  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love?  
  
I've been looking to the future  
And I've been dreaming of our past  
But now I'm counting on this moment  
'Cause it may be the last  
  
And days go by and still I try  
To reach into your soul  
There is only so far I can go

And all of the answers were clear  
Remember the times when our souls would ignite  
And passion explodes into fears

I remember love  
Do you remember love?

Pure as an infant's heart

I'll never wake again  
As I hold you tenderly  
My thoughts were real  
And being with you now is the only  
Thought that's strong,  
It's a lonely night, and I'm trying  
To hold on...

A distant tide come in, they always do  
A mother holds the son  
A lover waits alone, like me for you

Beyond the slighest doubt  
Before the dream is woken

I can make the final block  
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  
I can make all the stadiums rock  
I can make tonight forever  
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made  
And I can make all your demons be gone

Do you really want to see me crawl

I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
  
Untie the sails, the shore will melt away  
Without a trace, I hear the raven say  
When it's love, this is love, when it's love  
That we must know we must enter  
This is love, this is love, only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we' ve never seen  
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
Reach out for the shadow of the sun  
Cry out for the shadow of the sun  
You are the colors of the wind  
Singing hopes, eternal spring  
In a symphony for every lonely year  
You are the keeper of the key  
And the one that longs to be  
The light for each and every frozen tear

The air was still, the words would flow  
We knew each other oh so well  
And though just met you'd never tell  
Sometimes we're just lonely hearts  
That ride upon a floating card  
Prepared to live those sleepless nights  
For precious time in paradise  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  
There's no regrets, we made the choice  
We listened to that silent voice  
That haunts you 'til you just give in  
And makes you like a child again  
We drifted close then said goodbyes  
Just reading well each other's eyes  
The world had turned while we stood still  
And held on to each other  
And in between the right and wrong  
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I cried for it all  
She never heard me call at all

Inspiration is all we've got  
Hidden knowledge, can't get enough,  
Taking chances, making love  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, shedding skin  
Age of reason lies within  
Explanation, the club of Rome  
Meditation, and staying home  
Moving forward, the chosen few  
Teach your children what is new  
Band the table, beat the drum  
New messiah, overcome  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide

In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'  
Though your nose gets chillin'  
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way

Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please

Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please

Oh you must know where she's at, yes I've been a fool  
And I know that she's one of you, now do this for me, tell her please  
  
And if she's lonely I'll make her understand  
That these arms can carry both of us back to heaven again  
  
Yes I've been a fool and I know that she's one of you

In what once was our bed  
Trying to forget  
All the cruel words you said  
All the radio was playing  
What once was our favorite song

Clothes that I own  
And take it to the streets

Gonna put on my best moves  
On every single woman I see

Add me to your list  
Notch me on your gun

Don't write any letters  
Don't call me on the phone  
Don't knock on my door

There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again

Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....

Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down

You will always be the lady

My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart

And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me

Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great

Every night down at [Incomprehensible] Cafe  
All alone she sips her pina colada  
Talkin' to herself, dreamin' time away  
The story is that a dark haired stranger  
Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her, he'd come back and take her  
Around the world, bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Each afternoon as the snug boats come in  
She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset  
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Young sailors make a play to take her home  
She says, ""No, I'm already taken""  
Oh, they just laugh when she mentions his name  
She just keeps on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

No need to worry or get in a hurry  
Nothing to spend but time  
  
Light up a smoke and tell a few jokes  
And pass the old jug around  
We're gonna get right on a Saturday night  
When the sun goes down  
  
Down on the river, down on the river  
Just some old boys a making a lot of noise  
Down on the river, down on the river, down on the river  
If anyone calls tell them, we're all down on the river  
  
Well, we'll go fishing by the light of the moon  
And bait them hooks by hand  
Early in the morning take them off the line  
Fry 'em all up in a pan  
  
We gotta get home while we still got a job  
Or we'll have to answer to the man  
And everybody knows we gotta go

And all around are cowboys and cowgirls  
And thanks to them the music's still alive

Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys

I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,

Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around,  
We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

Stil wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned.  
Closing time, I drive for home not feelin' any pain.  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin' rain.  
Not caring if she ever come shome.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.

To the days when you were mine  
And i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I don't need no quarters  
Don't need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane

A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams

She never thought that love could ever end so soon

And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday

She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To a man who would love her and never let her down

'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch

And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights  
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust  
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust

A race against the time

Keeps telling him to go

Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find

Of stars that dance in the light

They say that love is but a dance  
Don't let the music fade away  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Don't let the moment pass

(I) Prelude  
  
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless.""

And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
In a circle  
Living in a world of perpetual motion  
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean  
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion  
Ridin on a wild carrousel  
You'll be turning round and round  
Round and round we go  
  
Promises, promises, promises, promises  
  
Round your finger  
After all the years we've been together  
Walking in the sun and stormy weather  
Sharing in a moment to last forever  
Memories and dreams without end  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
And it finds you in the darkness of the night  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for all to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
The ring is magic, magic, fire, fire  
The ring is mine

Taking my life  
One day at a time

Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now there's nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well it's all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
There's a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life

Remember before you grab the money and run

You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone

Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep

We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

I think I lost some weight there

I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free

Near the cliff up on the mountain

Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried

Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats

Purity over rot  
""Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair  
With head high and eyes alert  
  
I tread on a plane of many  
We who are of good nature and intention,  
But cannot touch on the dark  
Recesses of memory  
  
And pain learned, so come walk  
With me, feel the pain,  
And release it...""  
What the hell am I?  
  
Worn eroded pride  
Saddened 10 miles wide  
I'm gonna let it slide  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
  
Ahh, etc., etc.

Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
Yeah, hey Yeah, tears that soak  
A callous heart  
  
Why you act frightened  
I am enlightened  
Your weakness builds me  
So someday you'll see  
  
I stay away  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
I stay away (4x)
